Hi, my name is Parameswara Reddy Kypa. I have over 3 years of experience in IT, including more than 2 years as an AWS Cloud Engineer and around a year as an Oracle DBA. I'm currently working at Tata Consultancy Services in Bangalore.

In my current role, I focus on designing and automating secure, scalable cloud infrastructure on AWS. I work extensively with services like EC2, VPC, RDS, S3, and IAM. I also build Infrastructure as Code using CloudFormation and Terraform, and automate tasks using Python and Shell scripts.

My responsibilities also include cloud cost optimization, monitoring with CloudWatch, ensuring security compliance using GuardDuty and Config, and setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and CodePipeline. Prior to this, I managed over 3000 Oracle databases in a production environment.

I’m AWS Solutions Architect Associate certified and looking forward to contributing my cloud and DevOps skills in a dynamic cloud-native environment."
